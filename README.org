I am  a network and  systems engineer  currently working at  [[https://github.com/fi-ts/][FI-TS]] and
this is my github profile.

My current most liked language is go, previously this was perl. I used
to program in a bunch of other  languages like C, python or ruby. I do
almost all my work with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]], for which I wrote a couple of emacs modes.

The projects I am currently working on are:
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/rpnc/][rpnc]]: a commandline and interactive programmable reverse polish notation calculator
- [[https://github.com/tlinden/tablizer][tablizer]]: a console table manipulation tool
- [[https://github.com/tlinden/ephemerup][ephemerup]]: a ephemeral file upload system with rest API and commandline cli

The most fun projects I did in the past:
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/pcp][pretty curved  privacy]]: a tool to  encrypt and decrypt data  at rest
  using eliptic curves for the commandline.
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/diceware][diceware]]: a diceware password generator, which I use regularly.
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/udpxd][udpxd]]: a udp proxy supporting v4/v6 conversion.
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/twenty4][twenty4]]: a self-made cryptographic algorithm I created just for fun.

There are a couple of perl modules I am still maintaining:
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/Config-General][Config::General]]: a widely used configuration module.
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/Data-Validate-Struct][Data::Validate::Struct]]: can be used to validate recursive data structures.
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/Crypt--PWSafe3][Crypt::PWSafe3]]: a module to read and write passwordsafe.net files.
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/leo][leo]]: a commandline interface to https://dict.leo.org.

I  also maintain  (and use  daily)  the FreeBSD  jail management  tool
[[https://github.com/TLINDEN/jaildk][jaildk]]. Another fun shell script is  [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/goupdater][goupdater]], which I use to install
and  update  all those  go  binaries  which  are avaliable  as  direct
downloads.

And finally these are some emacs modes I maintain (and mostly use):
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/novel-mode][novel-mode]]: a simple mode to use emacs as a comfortable screen reader.
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/mark-copy-yank-things-mode][mark-copy-yank-things-mode]]: Mark, Copy and Yank Things Emacs Minor Mode.
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/autoscratch][autoscratch]]: Automatically switch major mode from *scratch*.
- [[https://github.com/TLINDEN/viking-mode][viking-mode]]: Kill first, ask later - an emacs mode for killing things quickly.

My current emacs configuration can be found here: [[https://github.com/tlinden/dot-emacs][dot-emacs]].
