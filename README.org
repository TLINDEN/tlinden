* Tom von Dein

I am  a network and  systems engineer  currently working at  [[https://github.com/fi-ts/][FI-TS]] and
this is my github profile.

My current most liked language is go, previously this was perl. I used
to program in a bunch of other  languages like C, python or ruby. I do
almost all my work with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]], for which I wrote a couple of emacs modes.

I am not using github for my own projects anymore and moved all my repositories to [[https://codeberg.org/scip/][Codeberg]].

The projects I am currently working on are:
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/epuppy/][epuppy]]: terminal epub viewer
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/ts/][ts]]: generic cli timestamp parser and calculator tool
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/swayipc/][swayipc]]: go bindings to control sway and swayfx
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/swaycycle/][swaycycle]]: alt-tab window cycler for sway/swayfx, uses the swayipc module.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/sway-descratch/][sway-descratch]]: get back windows from scratchpad.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/kleingebaeck/][kleingebäck]]: a tool to backup kleinanzeigen.de ads.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/anydb][anydb]]: a personal key value store with more capabilities than skate.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/kageviewer][kageviewer]]: a live viewer for shaders written in Kage, similar to glslviewer
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/gfn][gfn]]: a cli tool to generate fantasy names for games and stories
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/gowipe][gowipe]]: a cli tool to securely delete files (not suited for SSD discs)
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/rpnc/][rpnc]]: a commandline and interactive programmable reverse polish notation calculator
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/yadu/][yadu]]: a go log/slog handler using a mix of log lines and yaml.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/valpass/][valpass]]: a small go module to verify passwords
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/tablizer][tablizer]]: a console table manipulation tool
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/ephemerup][ephemerup]]: a ephemeral file upload system with rest API and commandline cli
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/golsky][Golsky]]: a golang implementation of the game of life, supports RLE patterns, saving and loading,
  drawing, zooming and is controllable using key bindings.
- Openquell: a 2D puzzle game using ebitengine, arche and LDTK. Not (yet) opensource. [[https://bad-kraut.itch.io/openquell][Play it online]]

The most fun projects I did in the past:
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/pcp][pretty curved  privacy]]: a tool to  encrypt and decrypt data  at rest
  using eliptic curves for the commandline.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/diceware][diceware]]: a diceware password generator, which I use regularly.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/udpxd][udpxd]]: a udp proxy supporting v4/v6 conversion.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/twenty4][twenty4]]: a self-made cryptographic algorithm I created just for fun.

There are a couple of perl modules I am still maintaining:
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/Config-General][Config::General]]: a widely used configuration module.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/Data-Validate-Struct][Data::Validate::Struct]]: can be used to validate recursive data structures.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/Crypt--PWSafe3][Crypt::PWSafe3]]: a module to read and write passwordsafe.net files.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/leo][leo]]: a commandline interface to https://dict.leo.org.

I  also maintain  (and use  daily)  the FreeBSD  jail management  tool
[[https://codeberg.org/scip/jaildk][jaildk]].

And finally these are some emacs modes I maintain (and mostly use):
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/novel-mode][novel-mode]]: a simple mode to use emacs as a comfortable screen reader.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/mark-copy-yank-things-mode][mark-copy-yank-things-mode]]: Mark, Copy and Yank Things Emacs Minor Mode.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/autoscratch][autoscratch]]: Automatically switch major mode from *scratch*.
- [[https://codeberg.org/scip/viking-mode][viking-mode]]: Kill first, ask later - an emacs mode for killing things quickly.

My current emacs configuration can be found here: [[https://codeberg.org/scip/dot-emacs][dot-emacs]].
